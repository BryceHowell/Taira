# Taira
My java game which is a lot like Adventure for the Atari 2600, but expanded.

# Compiling
Download all the files to a directory and use the following to recompile the class files.
> $ javac Taira.java

# Running
Make sure that labyrinth.txt, sprites.txt, and itemlist.txt are in the directory with the class files. These files are in an XML-like format that provides the data for the game world. In order to run the game, use the following:
> $ java Taira
