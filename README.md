# Taira
My java game which is a lot like Adventure for the Atari 2600, but expanded.

# Compiling
Download all the files to a directory and use the following to recompile the class files.
> $ javac Taira.java

# Running
Make sure that labyrinth.txt, sprites.txt, and itemlist.txt are in the directory with the class files. These files are in an XML-like format that provides the data for the game world. In order to run the game, use the following:
> $ java Taira
# Playing
Use the arrow keys and the spacebar to move around and use the current object.
The WASD keys let you select an object in the inventory display on the bottom of the screen. The current object is outlined by a cursor square.
X will let you drop an object.
